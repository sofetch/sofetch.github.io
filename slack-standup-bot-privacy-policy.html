<h1>Standupbot.com Privacy Policy</h1>
 
<p>
We totally respect the privacy of your data, and understand your projects are a big deal. This policy explains how and when Standup Bot collects, uses, and shares your information when you use it.
</p>

<p>
Standup Bot receives your information through the Slack APIs, widgets, buttons, and commerce services. While using Standup Bot, you agree to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, and disclosure of the information for your team’s use. This information will be displayed for team viewing within your Slack team.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of what country your team is operating from, you authorize the collection of your data in the United States, and any other country So Fetch operates in. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact standupbot@sofetch.io.
</p>

<h3>Collecting Information</h3>

<p>
When you integrate Standup Bot in your Slack team, the Slack API provides us with you and your team members’ information, such as your username, name, timezone, and profile pictures. This information is collected and shared as part of Standup Bot’s daily summary to your team only.
</p>

<p>
Any information you provide us with while troubleshooting, via Github or email, is saved to make Standup Bot better. This information is kept private to So Fetch. 
</p>

<p>
Your payments are processed through a third-party credit card processor called Stripe. Your credit card info is never stored with us — it’s sent directly to Stripe, using SSL encryption.
</p>

<p>
Like many sites, we may use cookies to save additional usage data to improve our services. A cookie is a tiny data file transferred to your computer’s hard drive. Standup Bot may use session cookies and persistent cookies to try and understand you better. You may instruct your browser to not accept cookies by changing your settings, but some of our services may not function.
</p>

<p>
We only access your account if you’re having a problem. We might receive log data when you’re using our services. This data includes your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, device information, location, mobile carrier (if using Slack’s mobile app), cookie information, and search terms. This data just shows us when you’re interacting with Standup Bot in Slack.
</p>

<p>
We incorporate third-party services to make this party happen. Our use of third-party services only expands to Github and Heroku. Our third-party partners may share information with us such as browser cookie ID, visited website URLs, mobile device IDs, or email addresses.
</p>

<h3>Sharing Information</h3>

<p>
We aren’t disclosing any of your information to anyone but your team. We only use your personal data to better Standup Bot and deliver standup summaries. That was easy!
</p>

<p>
We will never sell your information to a third party, nor will we use your name for marketing purposes without your permission. If we have to give your information to comply with a law, regulation, legal request, we will. In the event that Standup Bot is involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will still apply to your information as part of the new entity. 
</p>

<p>
You can permanently delete your Standup Bot account by emailing us at standupbot@sofetch.io.
</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy could be revised from time to time, but the most recent version will always be made available. You will be notified of any changes to our privacy policy by the email address associated with your account. By using the service after receiving any change in the Privacy Policy, you agree to the changes.
