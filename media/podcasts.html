<h3>Podcast Information</h3>
<p>
I love doing podcast interviews! It gives me a chance to meet someone new! 
</p>


Over the years, these are a few things I've learned to request before jumping on an interview with you:

<ul>
  <li>Length of Podcast: Can we time-box the interview to no longer than 30-minutes? If my attention span for podcasts is about 30 minutes (the average morning car-ride into work for most) I'd like to pass that same appreciation for time onto the listeners.</li>
  <li>What do I need to do for you? Very few podcasters send me a detailed list of what I need to download/install/signup for, so if you could send me that, that would be outstanding. (can email it to <a href="mailto:corey@sofetch.io">corey@sofetch.io</a>)</li>
  <li>Scheduling: I'm not a fan of scheduling things months in advance, they usually get cancelled. If we can plan to do the interview within the next 7-10 business days, lets do it - send me a calendar invite immediately if you can for Monday through Friday, 10AM EST to 3PM EST and I'll do my best to make that happen. If not, I'll request an update and we'll just go from there.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Let me know if the above is too rigid. These things are the pet-peeves I've encountered over the years and decided to put it in writing so I can improve it over time.
</p>

Also, I have an example of what was sent to me by someone that wanted to interview me. They actually created this after I asked for it, since I told them it would help start a "process" for them.
