<h2>Hi, we're SoFetch. We work on software.</h2>

<h3>Podcast Example (feel free to steal it)</h3>

<h4>1. Recording Software</h4>
 We use Zencastr (Audio Only -- download/signup required) to record. 
Headphones usage during recording is strongly recommended, as well as a quiet room. Zencastr does not work with a mobile browser, a desktop version of the Firefox or Chrome web browser is required as well. A link to the recording will be provided via email, approximately 5mins prior to the start of the podcast.

If you don't have one, the microphone in the Apple Earpods sounds ok. Just make sure it's not rubbing on facial hair, shirts, or jackets when you move.

<h4>2. Talking Points</h4>
I generally ask the same 3 questions, and it will be the basis for our conversation:

<ul>
<li>Who are you/What do you do?</li>
<li>How did you get into programming?</li>
<li>What do you do to keep up with learning programming today? </li>
</ul>

Let me know if there’s anything else you’re excited about or you want to talk about.

<h4>3. General Interview Guidelines:</h4>

Feel free to get specific about your experiences and provide examples on what you're talking about. Also remember the target audience is people interested in how you got into coding, so try to define any tech terms, and use less jargon when possible.
