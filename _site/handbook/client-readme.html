<h2 id="starting-a-project">Starting A Project</h2>

<p><strong>Capture customer information</strong> - Every project begins with a customer going to our website and entering in some information for us. Most of this information is collected up front so that we can put contracts together quickly.</p>

<p><strong>15-minute call</strong> – We will ask what you are wanting to accomplish and quickly explain how we work and what comes next.</p>

<p><strong>Slack</strong> - After our 15-minute chat we create a Slack private group named [project-name] for client business communication. This channel is to address additional questions dealing with the business of this project.
MSA &amp; SOW – After our initial chat we create and send out our Master Service Agreement &amp; Statement of Work for your project.</p>

<p><strong>Sign MSA &amp; SOW</strong> - You view and sign our document via Hellosign.</p>
