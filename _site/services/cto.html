<!--
Why am I writing? To get interim CTO work from a company that either just lost their CTO, or is currently looking to place a long-term CTO

What do I want to say? To give a few examples of what they're experiencing currently and how I could benefit them in those areas

What do I want to accomplish? (What is my motivation for writing?) I want to be able to get the prospect on the phone

What is the next step? Will my reader know what the next step is, and who is to take that action? To schedule a call with me

<h2 id="interim---chief-technology-officer-cto">Interim - Chief Technology Officer (CTO)</h2>

<h4 id="when-would-i-need-a-part-time-cto-for-my-company">When would I need a part-time CTO for my company?</h4>

<p>You:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Lost your current CTO and need a replacement quick to keep things moving forward</li>
  <li>Need a CTO to get your software built so you can pitch to investors to get funding</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="we-lost-our-cto-and-we-need-to-keep-our-software-platform-moving-forward">We lost our CTO and we need to keep our software platform moving forward</h4>

<p>The biggest problem with most software these days is <strong>“key-person risk”</strong>. When a CTO or developer from a team walks out the door, they take all that information with them.</p>

<p>We recognize how often this happens and have created processes to help us navigate existing software projects without us having any prior knowledge.</p>

<p>If we need to talk to anyone, we also know how to track down who we need to talk to by looking at the code to help us jump in and start delivering.</p>

<h4 id="we-want-to-level-up-our-software-development-team">We want to level-up our software development team</h4>

<p>If you have a director of development, or a vice-president of engineering, we fit nicely right next to them on a temporary basis. Your current team members are focused on delivering the value day-to-day. Having an Interim CTO can supercharge your current efforts by looking at your team’s current processes and retrofit them to industry standard processes.</p>

<p>The end goal is to be able to onboard new developers quickly which allows you to build your team quicker and helps the current team work better.</p>

<h4 id="i-have-an-idea-and-i-want-to-pitch-investors">I have an idea and I want to pitch Investors</h4>

<p>The main goal you have right now is to get your software built at this point. You should look into hiring us for our <a href="/services/software-development">software development services</a> instead.</p>
