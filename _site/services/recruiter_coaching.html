<h4 id="the-current-problem-with-your-job">The current problem with your job</h4>

<p>Most in your field are not willing to put in the time to fully understand all aspects of recruiting for software developers and designers. If you’re reading this you’re already step ahead of your competitors (and teammates) to getting more money in your pocket.</p>

<h4 id="what-you-have-now">What you have now</h4>

<p>You <strong>kinda</strong> understand what the client is looking for. And you <strong>kinda</strong> have an idea of what the candidate is looking for. And you might also be able to tell from a technical stand point if the person you are considering has the chops to get the job.</p>

<h4 id="what-you-want">What you want</h4>

<p>You want to place more people out of your current pool than normal. A higher conversion rate for you means more people place, money in your pocket, and happer clients that will refer their CTO friends to you.</p>

<h4 id="what-you-need-right-now">What you need right now</h4>

<p>A solid developer turned CTO turned CEO. A developer you can call on to verify what you have to make sure you’re not shooting yourself in the foot when you try to talk to a developer that you’d like to place. And the same developer can talk to you from the CTO side to make sure you understand what your client is really asking for.</p>
