<h2>Hi, we're SoFetch. We work on software.</h2>
<p>
We have a pool of our own cash to invest. We want to talk to teams that could use our cash to blow their shit up. We have tons of experience with technology startups. And, we want to help local Jacksonville, Florida teams get big. We're done with helping teams that are not in our home city.
</p>

<p>
There are a few requirements to get our money. We love Jacksonville, Florida, so being based locally is a requirement. Here are a few of the main requirements below:

<ul>
  <li>You have to be building software to solve a problem (it can be any industry)</li>
  <li>You have to be based in Jacksonville, Florida. (Your teammates, don't have to be, we don't care where they are)</li>
  <li>You will get $2,000/month, for a period of 12 months, for a grand total of $24,000 cash to get your small technology business growing.</li>
  <li>You will get $0 for each month that you don't hit your goals you've set at the beginning of the month. This isn't kindergarten, this is business, you need to learn how to act like one.</li>
  <li>You have to already have your idea "working" on paper, or in a spreadsheet. Either way, you can't come to us with just an idea. Ideas are cheap.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You can start something that deals with religion, the adult-industry, finance, or whatever it is you want. We don't care what industry it's in. We're comfortable with most of them. We love everything business as long as it's legal.
