<h3 id="squarecom">Square.com</h3>

<p>Square needed a concept application built that closely mimics their flagship financial platform for taking payments. They needed the prototype soon and did not have time to micro-manage another team. After giving SoFetch high-level requirements, SoFetch was able to cut out needless features based off past experience building software against a tight deadline. Once the scope was prioritzed to a comfortable amount, SoFetch delivered the working prototype earlier than the deadline given.</p>

<p>Assisted with coaching internal development team with Agile methodologies and automated regression testing. SoFetch used experience from the previous two decades of building software to help implement daily standups, unit testing, and high-level integration testing. Using Ruby paired with Cucumber and RSpec libraries to create a suite of regression tests, SoFetch was able to lower the total number of bugs while simultaneously improving revenue by making sure the software did not break during valuable business interactions with customers.</p>

<p>A year after inception of LEFTA, there was massive onboarding of Law Enforcement officers that started using the software program to track field reports. Realizing they needed expert software development, LEFTA hired SoFetch for a period of time for consulting to help improve the software architecture to handle the scale of new customers. This was one of our first projects. There was a mix of technologies, PHP and Perl, what we used in SoFetch’s earlier work. Now we use Ruby extensively.</p>

<h3 id="petamberalert">PetAmberAlert</h3>

<p>Focusing on giving back to the community, SoFetch invested in building a platform to help locate family pets that have escaped yards, or homes. Pets, at the time and still to this day, are part of the family. To “give back”, SoFetch built a platform that allowed pet owners to notify, via standard text messages, the surrounding network of people on the system to look for lost pets. This system was a success before taking too much time and was later abandoned. PetAmberAlert.com is still working today as a different company has started the platform and gone with it.</p>
