Square needed a concept application built that closely mimics their flagship financial platform for taking payments. They needed the prototype soon and did not have time to micro-manage another team. After giving SoFetch high-level requirements, SoFetch was able to cut out needless features based off past experience building software against a tight deadline. Once the scope was prioritzed to a comfortable amount, SoFetch delivered the working prototype earlier than the deadline given.

Assisted with coaching internal development team with Agile methodologies and automated regression testing. SoFetch used experience from the previous two decades of building software to help implement daily standups, unit testing, and high-level integration testing. Using Ruby paired with Cucumber and RSpec libraries to create a suite of regression tests, SoFetch was able to lower the total number of bugs while simultaneously improving revenue by making sure the software did not break during valuable business interactions with customers.
