### Square.com

Square needed a concept application built that closely mimics their flagship financial platform for taking payments. They needed the prototype soon and did not have time to micro-manage another team.

Once the scope was prioritzed to a comfortable amount, SoFetch delivered the working prototype earlier than the deadline given.
