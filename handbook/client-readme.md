## Starting A Project

**Capture customer information** - Every project begins with a customer going to our website and entering in some information for us. Most of this information is collected up front so that we can put contracts together quickly.

**Schedule Appointment** - After filling out the Onboarding information the customers will then be directed to schedule an appointment for a 15-minute call.

**15-minute call** – We will ask what you are wanting to accomplish and quickly explain how we work and what comes next. 

**Slack** - After our 15-minute chat we create a Slack private group named [project-name] for client business communication. This channel is to address additional questions dealing with the business of this project.
MSA & SOW – After our initial chat we create and send out our Master Service Agreement & Statement of Work for your project.

**Sign MSA & SOW** - You view and sign our document via Hellosign.

**Harvest** - After your MSA & SOW are signed we add your project to Harvest our time tracking and invoicing application.

**Invoice** - We send over an invoice for the initial deposit as outlined in the MSA & SOW to the contact email address collected from our Onboarding process.

**We start working** - We put our heads down and work to get your project completed.

**Estimates** - The estimates we give at this point are good for 30 days. After that, we start from scratch.

## Rate

**Day rate** - We price out our projects per person, per day.

**Designers & Developers** - Our designers and developers use the same day rate. We don't value one skill set over the other. They both solve unique problems.

**Project Sprints** – During our 15-minute call we will explain our process for Project Sprints and come up with a rough plan for yours.
 
## Contracts

**NDA's** – We'd love to have the time to read through and sign your NDA but the reality of the matter is that we don't. The good news for you is that we aren't in the business of stealing ideas. 

**HelloSign** - The contracts that we do send over will be sent over and signed via HelloSign.com. It's a fast, secure and legally binding way to obtain eSignatures for Business.

## Payments

**ACH** - We prefer that all payments are made through ACH. The transaction fees are lower, they are more secure, and it's easy to setup recurring payments.

**Online Payments** – We track time and send invoices through Harvest. We accept online payments via Stripe through Harvest. As of June 1, 2015 a 2% transaction fee will be added to non ACH payments.

## Web Apps & Software
