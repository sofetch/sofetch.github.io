First few steps that need to be taken care of:

1. Make sure the root domain rootdomain.com can be pointed to the marketing site
2. When building an application of any type, point app.rootdomain.com to the app
3. As far as email goes, just set up Gmail, don't use Mailgun or anything to manage your email, it'll be easier to have people come onboard
