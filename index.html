<h2>Hi, we're SoFetch. Welcome to our website.</h2>

<h3>We are experienced software technologists that have been writing code since the 1990's.</h3>

You're on our site probably looking for one of the following things:
<ul>
	<li>An experienced CTO to lead your technology team (temporarily?)</li>
	<li>A team to take your idea and turn it into a mobile or web application</li>
	<li>A team to take the reigns of an internal project (feature/bug/maintenance) to get done that you don't need to staff up for</li>
</ul>

<h3>An experienced CTO to lead your technology team</h3>

<p>
Software development shouldn't be black-magic. Organizations aren't looking for a rockstar team that writes code with amazing speed. They're looking for a rockstar team that knows what code to write first and then writes it with amazing speed.
</p>

<p>
Building bad-ass software means you're going to be involved with our conversations daily (the exception of course is if you're a start-up with nothing right now and want a team to take an idea and run with it. We have plenty of experience building our own successful SaaS products that will make your project a success).
</p>

<h3>A team to take your idea and turn it into a mobile or web application</h3>
<p>
If your idea is a mobile application or a web application, we handle both.  As far as design goes though, we don't do any design ourselves. We have a small list of extremely badass design companies we reach out to when we need to call on them to get any UI/UX work done. 
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, we're the ship builders of the software world. We love to work on ships of all sizes and shapes and see them set sail as soon as possible. A lot of those ships are still sailing today with minor fixes here and there to keep'em going.  That's how we like to do.
</p>

<h3>How much is this gonna cost me?</h3>
<p>
Our rates are competitive and most of the time only 2 of our developers are on a project at a time. We charge 2-weeks of developer time up-front before the work is started. We keep to a payment schedule that the next 2 weeks of work are already paid for. It's just easier. We're not bill-collectors, we're software developers. We don't negotiate this part, some have tried and we just don't deviate from this part of our process.
</p>

<h3>Do we do work on projects for equity?</h3>
<p>
Our view on equity is extremely strict. We've come close on one project. Our only requirement to have that conversation is we need to have already worked on your platform for 6-weeks. 
</p>
