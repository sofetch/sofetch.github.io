  <h1>Hi, we're SoFetch. We work with software.</h1>
  <hr/>


1. Higher level stuff; meeting with accountant, numbers, looking at financials
This is why i wouldn't buy your business
These numbers need to change/be improved

Looking at business critically like an investor
making it sellable

You started your business for a reason, right?

You wanted to make more money than you would working for someone else.

You wanted to have flexible work hours so you could spend more time with your family,  go on last-minute trips, and long lunches with old friends if you wanted.

You also probably wanted to have others working for you so you could build your business into a multimillion dollar organization so you could secure your retirement and not have to worry about working into your golden years.

My guess is, you are probably not getting most of those things.

How do you get from where you’re at now to the place you want to be? You need accountability. You need a business coach to help keep you on track, because no one else is going to sign up to help you.

Yes, a business coach is going to cost money.

Yes, there are plenty out there that have no clue what they’re doing, and it’ll be hard to trust them.

Yes, you’re going to go through growing pains to fix the habits you’ve created so far with your business.

Yes, you’re going to have to remove your ego to allow someone to help you since you can’t see the forest for the trees.

Are you ready?

We have the playbook. We’ve built businesses before. We’ve had them acquired. We’ve been investors, we put money where our mouth is.

Pricing? We can work that out, based off the size of your business.

The first thing to do is, make sure you really want to build your business so you’re a business owner, not someone working in a business.
