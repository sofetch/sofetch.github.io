<h2>Hi, we're SoFetch. We work on software.</h2>

You're on our site because You:
<ul>
	<li><b>have a start-up (or new business)</b> and you don't have the budget or the time to make mistakes with your software. You need a <a href="#ptcto">part-time CTO</a>.</li>
	<li><b>have an idea</b> and do not want to waste your money and hire multiple teams and still not have something to show for it (we've seen that movie before). <a href="#hireteam">Hire a team that has built their own products</a>.</li>
	<li><b>have maintenance work</b> that needs to be done on your current software, like adding features, fixing bugs, or adding tests to your current testless system. <a href="#maintenance">Cash-in on our experience to whip your software into better shape quickly</a></li>
	<li><b>already know you want to work with us</b> because we're extremely good at what we do. <a href="#phonecall">Go straight to setting up a call with us</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ptcto">Part-time CTO</h3>

<p>
Most start-ups and early stage ventures already have a "technical cofounder" or "VP of Engineering/Development". Those roles are extremely technical. The things those roles are missing that we can fill are: 
<ul>
	<li>Identifying where to hire new developers from</li>
	<li>Onboarding new developers quickly (save a lot of $$$)</li>
	<li>Evangelize the business to technical types</li>
	<li>Market the technical team</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="hireteam">Hire a team that has built their own products</h3>
<p>
You're wanting to build a platform that generates revenue? Is it going to be SaaS-y? Great. We've built a couple of our own. You need a team that:  
<ul>
	<li>Realizes the difference between writing efficient code and <b>shipping working software to customers</b></li> 
	<li>Knows when and where to <b>scope-cut to get the platform to market</b></li> 
	<li>Understands what metrics to capture to <b>supercharge growth</b></li> 
	<li>Isn't your neighbor's brother that will do it for 1/3 the cost and not deliver anything in a respectable time (also have seen this movie)</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="maintenance">We love maintenance work</h3>
<p>
A lot of software development companies hate to take on maintenance work. It's <b>not sexy</b> or requires <b>writing a lot of automated tests</b> before writing actual code to improve the current system. 
</p>

<p>
Maintenance work is hard, fun, and can <b>reduce future software development costs by multiples of 10</b>. For us to take on your maintenance projects we need buy-in from you and the other stakeholders on realistic expectations of how long it will take to see results, though. Just forewarning.
</p>
</p>

<h3 id="cost">How much is this going to cost?</h3>
We are competitively priced. We: 
<ul>
	<li>Charge $4,000/week per-head.</li>
	<li>Charge 2-weeks of developer time up-front before the work is started.</li>
	<li>Keep to a payment schedule that 2 weeks of work are paid for before we start work.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's easier and less headache for everyone involved. <b>We're not bill-collectors, we're software developers</b>. We don't negotiate this part. Some have tried. It keeps it extremely easy for both our customers and ourselves so we can all stay focused on building your software well.
</p>

<h3>Do we do work on projects for equity?</h3>
<p>
Yes and No. Our requirement is: we need to have already worked on your platform for at least 12 weeks. This allows us to see how your team/stakeholders work together and if we all work together well, too.
</p>

<h3 id="phonecall">Schedule a phone call with us</h3>
<p>
Don't worry, you're not wasting our time by scheduling a call with us. We love talking to people.
