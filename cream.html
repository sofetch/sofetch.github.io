<h2>Hi, we're SoFetch. We work on software.</h2>
<p>
We have a pool of cash to invest. It's a small pool, but a pool that a team could use to blow their shit up. We have tons of experience in this area and  we're a little bored, so we want to help a team get big, too.
</p>

<p>
There are a few requirements. We love Jacksonville, Florida, so that definitely plays a role in the requirements to get cash are listed below:

<ul>
  <li>You have to be building software to solve a problem (it can be any industry)</li>
  <li>You have to be based in Jacksonville, Florida. (Your teammates, don't have to be, we don't care where they are)</li>
  <li>You will get $2,000/month, for a period of 12 months, for a grand total of $24,000 cash to get your small technology business growing.</li>
  <li>You will get $0 for each month that you don't hit your goals you've set at the beginning of the month. This isn't kindergarten, this is business, you need to learn how to act like one.</li>
  <li>You have to already have your idea "working" on paper, or in a spreadsheet. Either way, you can't come to us with just an idea. Ideas are cheap.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You can start something that is religous, or in the adult-industry, or finance, or whatever it is you want. We don't care what industry it's in, we're comfortable with most of them.
</p>
