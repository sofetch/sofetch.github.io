What is the goal of the recruiters job? placing people into jobs and having them come back when they leave

Why am I writing? To sell recruiters the idea of being coached

What do I want to say? I want to explain I can help them build their own systems on paper to excel more than the software after their jobs

What do I want to accomplish? (What is my motivation for writing?)  I want to get hired by recruiters for 12 weeks of coaching to increase their placements and lower the time they spend on most of the tasks they do now

What is the next step? Will my reader know what the next step is, and who is to take that action? To have a brief phone conversation for around 15 minutes to go over a one of their current placements to show them I can be their secret weapon

#### Recruiter Winners and Losers over the next 5 years

Its natural progression. The more recruiting software that is built and made available to companies to do their own recruiting, the less recruiters will be needed. 

Placing more people means a better lifestyle. Not placing enough people means having to find a new job.
