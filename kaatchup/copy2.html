    <h1>I Built This Because I Was Sick of Losing Touch</h1>
    <p>As a small business owner, I’d meet clients, leads, and partners—and then forget to follow up. Every lost conversation was lost money. Traditional CRMs were too bloated and annoying.</p>
    <p><strong>So, I built something better.</strong> A simple, no-BS system that helps you stay connected, close more deals, and grow your business—without the extra noise.</p>
