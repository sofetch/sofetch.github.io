    <h1>You're Losing Money Because You Suck at Follow-Ups</h1>
    <p>Clients forget you. Leads go cold. Your old customers move on. Traditional CRMs are a bloated mess—too much data entry, too many features you’ll never use.</p>
    <p><strong>This app fixes that.</strong> No spreadsheets. No setup. Just a dead-simple system that forces you to stay top of mind, so you can close more deals and keep customers coming back.</p>
